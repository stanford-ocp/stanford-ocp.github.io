## Dev environment configuration

### macOS
In order to test the website locally, you wll need Ruby and Bundler.

You can either use the version of Ruby that ships with macOS, or manage a version in `/usr/local/bin/ruby` using Homebrew:

```brew install ruby```

To install Bundler run:

```gem install bundler```

Now you can launch a local server by running:

```bundle exec jekyll serve```
